Help for DEFAULTCLOAK:

DEFAULTCLOAK allows operators to set a cloak to
the default for that account, as if the account
was just created and verified. This is equivalent
to using VHOST ON with a specific virtual host
based on the account name and its hash.

Syntax: DEFAULTCLOAK <nickname>

If the nickname is marked, you can override this
using the FORCE keyword.

Syntax: DEFAULTCLOAK <nickname> FORCE

Alternatively, to view what the default cloak
for an account would be, use the SHOW keyword.

Syntax: DEFAULTCLOAK <nickname> SHOW

Examples:
    /msg &nick& DEFAULTCLOAK former-gc
    /msg &nick& DEFAULTCLOAK She FORCE
