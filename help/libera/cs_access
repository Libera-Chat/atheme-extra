Help for ACCESS:

The ACCESS command allows displaying and changing
privileges on channels.

The LIST subcommand displays a list of users and
their privileges.

Syntax: ACCESS <#channel> LIST

The ADD subcommand adds a user to the access list
or changes their privileges if they were already on
the access list.

If the level field is specified, it specifies the
privileges to grant, see the FLAGS and TEMPLATE
help files. If not, the user will be given
privileges appropriate for day-to-day management
of the channel.

Syntax: ACCESS <#channel> ADD <nickname> [level]

The DEL subcommand removes a user from the access list.

Syntax: ACCESS <#channel> DEL <nickname>

Examples:
    /msg &nick& ACCESS #foo LIST
    /msg &nick& ACCESS #foo ADD bar OP
    /msg &nick& ACCESS #foo DEL bar
