[x] Theia database loader
[ ] Testing with large amounts of users, channels, etc
[ ] Missing features
  [x] message "libera is a service of ..." on registration
  [x] umode +e on grouped nicks
  [x] nickserv/set_unfiltered (not needed)
  [x] nickserv/extendchans
  [x] nickserv non-enforce recover/release? (or enforce)
  [x] nickserv/set_accountname (weakens identity!)
  [x] nickserv/set_private (should be smarter in what to show still)
  [x] IP matching for akicks
  [x] +d matching for /cs unban
  [x] ban forward tracking and matching for /cs unban
  [x] a way to deal with channel access lists
  [ ] last used time on channel access entries? (not so useful with roles)
  [x] chanserv unban only self? (code allows both, decision pending)

  [x] chanserv/op|voice on -nick?

[ ] New features
  [ ] group contact support
  [ ] group member support
  [ ] a command that allows helpers to drop nicks "expired" according to
      the policy
  [ ] look into accountability of channel ops towards channel ops
  [ ] *!*@libera/staff/* entries outside network channels seem more like
      some sort of flag, not a regular access entry

Things that will (most likely) go away:
- memoserv/reply
- chanserv/op|voice on multiple
- autodeop
- nick linking will be replaced by nick grouping
- nonoper nickserv/list
- nickserv/set_automask
- nickserv/set_secure
- nickserv/set_unsecure
- "contact" instead of "founder" in chanserv
- getting channel access from nickserv access lists (unless we implement
  this for sorcerynet)
- creation time on channel access entries (we have last modified time, and
  do not reverse the list on every restart)
- chanserv/set_alternate (automatically determined)
- channel passwords
- oper override for nickserv/ghost (use /kill)
- same-command oper override for most chanserv commands (there are
  chanserv/fflags and chanserv/ftransfer for example)
- the privacy-violating DCC interface
